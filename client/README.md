## Key Components

### Authentication
- Email-based login system with role detection
- Protected routes with role-based access control
- Mock authentication for prototype demonstration

### Layout System

## Mock Data

The application uses mock data for demonstration:
- Villa listings with images, pricing, and amenities
- User bookings and transaction history
- Promotional banners and featured content
- Notification and messaging data

## Styling Approach

- **Inline Styles**: All styling using React inline style objects
- **No External CSS**: No frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with adaptive layouts
- **Consistent Theme**: Unified color palette and typography
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle animations for enhanced UX

## Development Notes

- This is a **UI-only prototype** with no backend integration
- All data is mocked and stored in local state
- Authentication is simulated for demonstration purposes
- Some routes show placeholder pages marked as "Coming Soon"

## Future Enhancements

The current prototype focuses on core navigation and role-based functionality. Future iterations could include:

- Villa listing and filtering pages
- Booking management interfaces
- Messaging and notifications system
- Admin property and user management
- Payment integration simulation
- Calendar booking system
- Review and rating system
